This is a Multi Project Die (MPD) submission which contains designs created
during the FPGA Ignite Summer School 2024 at Heidelberg University. The designs
are listed below. More detailed descriptions can be found in the respective GitHub
projects. All designs are connected to an eFPGA created using the
[FABulous](https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous) Framework.

Refer to [README](docs/source/index.md) for get the design ready for a
submission.

## VGA Ignite

The design consists of a pixel processing unit (PPU) to generate image patterns
and a Video Graphics Array (VGA) Driver.
